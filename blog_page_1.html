          Ex-Arm is one of those shows that makes you question whether or not the people behind it had any idea what they were doing. Never before have a seen a show that failed in just about every aspect from the writing all the way down to the animation. Now, you may be wondering what I'm talking about, well, allow me to share this lil quote from my boyfriend, who had the misfourtune of walking in on me watching it... 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="bold">
         <strong>This looks like it was animated purely on the budget of $10 and the discontent of the animation staff.</strong>

        </p>
        <p class="ex">But it can't be that bad, <i>right?</i> It's genre is sci-fi and action, so at least there's some cool fight scenes that make up for it?</p>
        <br>
        <img class="exgif" src="images/ex-arm-anime.gif" alt="A fight scene from Ex-Arm where one of the characters appears to flail around randomly before hitting a man.">
        <p class="ex"><i>oh no...</i></p>
        <p class="ex">I think that really sets the stage for what we're dealing with here. The show is featured on Crunchy Roll, which is a streaming platform is home to some truly awesome shows, but Ex-Arm is certainly not one of them.</p>
