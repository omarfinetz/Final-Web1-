<p class="aboutme">This site was made by Olivia Marfinetz as a final project for her Web-1 class. She grew up in the age where household computers were common place and has been browsing the web since she was 10.</p>
     
<p class="aboutme">She has always found the idea of web design interesting, but never actually tried it herself until now.</p>

<p class="aboutme">While she knows she has a bit of a ways to go before she feels confident enough to use her web design skills in the job feild, she's grown to like HTML coding, so she'll be practicing. </p>
