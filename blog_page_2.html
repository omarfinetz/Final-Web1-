          I've mention in my previous post that Ex-Arm is a rather odd gem, a diamond in the rough if you will. Now, I wouldn't exactly call it a diamond. It's more like one of those cheap plastic gems you'd find in the craft store. But what the heck is this show even about? Well, I'm glad you asked!

        <p class="ex">Ex-Arm is based on a Japanese science fiction manga series written by HiRock and illustrated by Shinya Komi. The manga has some rather nice artwork with plenty of detail that the anime fails to recreate. Instead it has a really bad case of artsyle clash due to the cheap looking cgi.</p>
       <img class="clash" src="images/cgiclash.jpg">
       <p class="ex">Ex-Arm begins in the far off future 2014, Akira is your average teenage boy who one day dies in a car accident. Cut to 16 years later where a policewoman and her android sidekick get a hold of an AI called EX-ARM. Which apparently houses Akira's brain. Ex-Arm is uploaded into the android and she and Akira find themselve sharing a body and having to work together as they fight crime.</p>
        
        <p class="ex">That's the basic summary of the overall plot. I haven't read the manga, so I'm not sure if this is just an issue with the anime, but, the plot is both rushed and poorly written. The characters are very one-dimensional, and Akira, our main character, makes a lot of really foolish decsions. One such being waiting till the last minute to save a woman from a crime boss, only to fail and lament that he wasn't quick enough. He also seems rather chill for someone whose lost their body and is stuck working a dangerous job, which he had no choice in whether or not he wanted to do so in the first place. His android friend, who is so unintresting that I forgot hers, has little to no personality.</p>
        
        <p class="ex">The fact that it seems the anime was setting up a romance subplot btween the two is laughable, given the lack of chemistry between the two. Everyone else is badly written too to some extant. Between the bad characters and bad animation you'd be surpised to here there is some value to the show, and that it's pretty funny in an ironic way. There's too much going on in Ex-Arm to go over, so you'll have to watch it yourself. So trust me, it's so bad it's good!</p>
